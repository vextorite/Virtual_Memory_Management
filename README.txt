TO RUN THE PROGRAM: call javac to compile the program and then:
java OS1Assignment.java <filename>
where <filename> is the input file. The output will be saved to a file
called output-OS1

The program reads in the binary file 8 bytes at a time and creates an array. 
The program then reverses and unsigns the array. Using other methods defined 
to convert from binary to hex, the page reference is found and used to find
the physical address. This was then converted back into Hexadecimal before
being saved to a file. This is done for each line in the input file.
